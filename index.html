      <h3><strong>WHAT IS A DARK SKY Preserve?</strong></h3>
      <h4>FROM WIKIPEDIA:</h4>
      <p>A dark-sky preserve (DSP) is an area, usually surrounding a park or observatory, that restricts artificial light pollution. The purpose of the dark-sky movement is generally to promote astronomy. However, astronomy is certainly not the only objective of conserving a dark sky. A dark night sky is associated with many facets of history, philosophy, religion, societal development, poetry, song, mathematics, and science.[2] Hence, dark sky preservation is necessary to understand our environmental history. Different terms have been used to describe the areas as national organizations have worked independently to create their programs. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) uses International Dark Sky Reserve (IDSR) and International Dark Sky Park (IDSP). A third designation, International Dark Sky Sanctuary, was introduced in 2015.</p>

      <p>A dark night sky is a natural resource, just like plants, waterways, and wildlife. Recognizing this unique resource needed to be managed and protected, during 2000, DCNR declared Cherry Springs State Park its first Dark Sky Park.</p>
